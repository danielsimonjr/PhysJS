`be-184`. Bridge. Pippard coherence length.

The catalog equation is

```
1/ξ = 1/ξ₀ + 1/(α ℓ)
```

`ξ₀ = ℏ v_F / (π Δ)` is the clean BCS coherence length and `ℓ = v_F τ` the
mean free path (`be-182`). `pippard_eq` derives the harmonic sum from one
hypothesis: the energy scale `ℏ v_F / ξ` that sets the pair size is the sum of
the clean gap scale `π Δ` and an impurity-broadening scale `ℏ / (α τ)`.
Dividing by `ℏ v_F` and using `ℓ = v_F τ` gives the sum of inverse lengths.

The numerical constant `α` is convention-dependent (it depends on the
reference and on how the scattering time is defined) and is taken as a
positive hypothesis, not derived. The additivity of the two energy scales is
the physical premise, not a theorem here; BCS theory and the nonlocal kernel
are not proved. `ξ` is then `ξ₀ α ℓ / (ξ₀ + α ℓ)`; `coherence_le` gives the
clean and dirty bounds, and `sum_of_lengths_not_pippard` separates the
arithmetic sum from the harmonic one.

/-- Pippard harmonic sum from additive energy scales.

`hξ0` is `ξ₀ = ℏ v_F / (π Δ)`. `hℓ` is `ℓ = v_F τ`. `hscale` is
`ℏ v_F / ξ = π Δ + ℏ / (α τ)`. `π` is passed as a positive real `p` so that
the statement does not depend on its value.

Kind `bridge` on `PhysJS.PippardCoherence.pippard_eq`, once the catalog
entry exists. `α` is a
convention-dependent hypothesis; not a derivation of BCS `ξ₀`. -/
