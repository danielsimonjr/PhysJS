`be-84`. Bridge. Collinear four-point sheet resistance.

The catalog equation is

```
R_s = (π / ln 2) (V / I)
```

for an infinite thin sheet and four equally spaced collinear probes.
`sheet_eq` derives it. A point source on a homogeneous sheet sends current
`I` through every circle, so the radial field is `(I R_s) / (2 π r)` and
the potential drop is the integral of `1/r`. Probes sit at `0`, `s`, `2 s`,
and `3 s`. Current `I` enters at `0` and leaves at `3 s`. The inner pair
reads `V`. Each contact contributes `(I R_s / (2 π)) ln 2`, and Laplace's
equation is linear, so the drops add. `unequal_not_equal` moves the sink
to `4 s`. The factor is then `2 π / ln 3`, not `π / ln 2`. This is not
`PhysJS.Crossing`, the conformal four-point function.
