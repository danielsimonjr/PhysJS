`be-204`. Bridge. Log-mean temperature difference of a counterflow exchanger.

The catalog equation is

```
Q = U A ΔT_lm,    ΔT_lm = (ΔT₁ − ΔT₂) / ln(ΔT₁ / ΔT₂)
```

`lmtd_eq` derives it from the steady counterflow equations along the
exchanger, `x ∈ [0, L]`, with constant conductance per length `a` (so
`U A = a L`) and constant stream heat capacity rates `C_h`, `C_c`:

```
C_h dT_h/dx = −a (T_h − T_c),    C_c dT_c/dx = −a (T_h − T_c)
```

(hot stream flows toward `+x`, cold stream toward `−x`). The proof solves for
the local difference `Δ(x) = T_h − T_c`, which decays as `exp(−κ x)` with
`κ = a (1/C_h − 1/C_c)`, gets the stream energy balance from the same
equations, and eliminates the heat duty `Q = C_h (T_h(0) − T_h(L))`. The balanced
case `C_h = C_c` (where `Δ` is constant and the formula is `0/0`) is included
with the removable-singularity convention `lmtd x x = x`.

Scope: constant `U`, constant heat capacities, steady state, no phase change,
no losses. Not a derivation of `U`. The logarithmic mean is not the
arithmetic mean (`arithmetic_mean_wrong`).
