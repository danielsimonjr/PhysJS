`be-240`. Bridge. Young's modulus and Poisson ratio from bulk and shear moduli.

The catalog equations are

```
E = 9 K G / (3 K + G)        ν = (3 K − 2 G) / (2 (3 K + G))
```

The premise is isotropic Hooke's law `σ_ij = λ tr(ε) δ_ij + 2G ε_ij` with
`K = λ + 2G/3`. In a uniaxial-stress test `σ_xx = σ`, `σ_yy = σ_zz = 0`, the
definitions are `E = σ / ε_xx` and `ν = −ε_yy / ε_xx` (with `ε_yy = ε_zz` by
isotropy). `young_eq` and `poisson_eq` solve the three Hooke equations for
`E` and `ν`. `stability` shows `E > 0` and `−1 < ν < 1/2` for `K, G > 0`.

It does not derive Hooke's law, and it assumes a linear, isotropic solid
with `K, G > 0`; negative moduli are outside the stability range.

/-- Uniaxial-stress test in isotropic Hooke's law. With `σ_yy = σ_zz = 0` and
`ε_yy = ε_zz = ε₂`, the first two Hooke equations give `E` and `ν`.

`hσ` is `σ_xx = λ(ε₁ + 2ε₂) + 2G ε₁`, `hlat` is `0 = λ(ε₁ + 2ε₂) + 2G ε₂`,
`hK` is `K = λ + 2G/3`, `hE` and `hν` are the definitions.

Kind `bridge` on `PhysJS.ModuliRelation.young_eq`, once the catalog entry
exists. Not a derivation
of Hooke's law. -/
