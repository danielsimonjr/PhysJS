`be-214`. Bridge. Gray-body radiation exchange between parallel plates.

The catalog equation is

```
q = σ (T₁⁴ − T₂⁴) / (1/ε₁ + 1/ε₂ − 1)
```

`gray_exchange_eq` derives it from the radiosity balance of two large,
diffuse, gray, parallel plates in vacuum. Each plate leaves with radiosity
`J = ε σ T⁴ + (1 − ε) G` (emission plus reflected irradiation), and the
irradiation of each plate is the radiosity of the other,
`G₁ = J₂`, `G₂ = J₁`. The net flux from plate 1 to plate 2 is
`q = J₁ − J₂`. Eliminating the radiosities gives the sum of three series
radiative resistances, `1/ε₁ − 1`, `1`, `1/ε₂ − 1`, in the denominator.

`σ` is a given constant here: the value `σ = 2π⁵k_B⁴/(15 h³c²)` is `be-165`,
and `E_b = σ T⁴` per plate is taken as the black-body emissive power
(hypothesis). Kirchhoff's law for the gray surface, absorptivity equal to
emissivity, is also a hypothesis, built into the radiosity balance.

`black_limit` is `ε₁ = ε₂ = 1`, `denominator_ge_one` shows a gray exchange never
exceeds the black one, and `emissivities_not_forced` separates the
denominator from the naive product or mean of `ε`.

Scope: infinite parallel geometry, gray diffuse surfaces, no medium, no
conduction. Not a derivation of `ε`.

powers are `σ T₁⁴` and `σ T₂⁴`.
