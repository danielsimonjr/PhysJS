`be-233`. Bridge. Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth.

The catalog equation is

```
Δν = π h ν (Δν_c)² / P
```

`linewidth_eq` derives it from a phase-diffusion model. With `N` photons
in the mode the output power is `P = N h ν γ`, where `γ = 2π Δν_c` is the
energy decay rate of the passive cavity (`Δν_c` its full width in Hz).
Spontaneous emission into the mode occurs at the rate `R_sp = n_sp γ`; at
full inversion `n_sp = 1`. Each event adds a unit-amplitude phasor with
uniformly random phase `χ` to a field of amplitude `√N`, rotating the field
phase by `Δφ ≈ sin χ / √N`. Its mean square is `m / N` with
`m = (1/2π) ∫₀^{2π} sin² χ dχ = 1/2` (`meanSinSq_eq`). The phase variance
grows at `V = R_sp m / N`, the field correlation decays as `exp(−V t/2)`
and the Lorentzian full width in Hz is `Δν = V / (2π)`. Substituting gives
`Δν = 2π m n_sp h ν (Δν_c)² / P`, which is the catalog form for `m = 1/2`,
`n_sp = 1`.

Scope. The coefficient is model dependent: the literature quotes forms
differing by a factor of 2, depending on whether the output power, the
intracavity power or the energy decay rate is used and on the treatment of
the spontaneous-emission phasor. `coefficient_not_fixed` shows that a
different per-event phase variance `m` rescales the result, so the
coefficient is a premise of the stated model and not a unit consequence.
This file does not derive the model from quantum noise theory. It is an
ideal four-level, single-mode, above-threshold statement.

/-- Schawlow-Townes linewidth at full inversion, `m = 1/2`.

`hm` is the phase average of `sin²`, taken from `meanSinSq`.

Kind `bridge` on `PhysJS.SchawlowTownes.linewidth_eq`, once the catalog
entry exists. Not a
quantum-noise derivation of the model, and the coefficient is that of the
stated phase-diffusion model. -/
