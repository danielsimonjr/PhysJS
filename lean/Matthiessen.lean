`be-144`. Bridge. Matthiessen's rule.

The catalog equations are

```
1/τ = 1/τ₁ + 1/τ₂
ρ = ρ₁ + ρ₂
```

when each resistivity is proportional to the scattering rate of one
mechanism. `matthiessen` derives both. Independence is the hypothesis that
the joint survival is the product of the exponential survivals,

```
exp(−t / τ) = exp(−t / τ₁) exp(−t / τ₂)
```

`Real.exp` is injective, so the rates add. The common Drude factor
`ρ_i = C / τ_i` then makes the resistivities add. A mechanism that changes
the distribution, rather than only the lifetime, is outside this sum. The
times are nonzero. This is not a collision integral.

/-- Matthiessen's rule.

`hsurv` is independence of the two Poisson processes. `hρ`, `hρ1`, and
`hρ2` are one Drude factor `C` on each lifetime.

Kind `bridge` on `PhysJS.Matthiessen.matthiessen`, once the catalog entry
exists. Not a collision
